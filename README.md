# Some Thoughts On The Use of Word

This repository contains a short document I created to capture
the most important points of using Microsoft Word effectively and
efficiently. Portions are a bit dated, as some of this content
dates back to the early 2000s.  On the other hand, the underlying
data structures that drive how Word operates haven't really
changed that much, so the basic information remains useful. 

The current version is based on Word 2016 running on Windows 10,
but that specific shouldn't really matter that much.  And a few
sections could really use an update. And there are some
formatting issues on the [GitHub pages
display](https://dlemire60.github.io/) that need addressing,
because of this shift from having this content _in_ Word to
putting it in Markdown. I'll get there, eventually.

If you want to help, feel free to chip in.
